This my welcome page for information about what I am doing in my class _INFOTEC 1000_. _INFOTEC 1000_ is properly known as INFOTEC 1000: Introduction to Information Technology. This class serves as an introduction to topics and jobs within the IT field. I am currently taking this class as one of my first classes as an IT major. This website is to discuss the different types of projects and programming languages that I have learned throughout this course thus far.  

I am currently using [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) to host this personal website.  

One of the first programs I ever wrote was a program called _AboutMe.py_ which was a simple code meant to introduce us to the Python syntax.  

The intro code is as shown below:  
```
print("Hello, my name is Faith Carter.")  
print("I am in this class because I am majoring in information technology.")  
print("I am a sophomore.")  
print("I am a transfer student.")  
```
