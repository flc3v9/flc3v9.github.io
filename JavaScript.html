For this assignment of _INFOTEC 1000_, we were expected to learn **JavaScript** and brush up on **HTML**. If you want to read more about my intro to HTML, check [here](HTMLbeginnings.md). [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a languages that is often used in conjunction to HTML and CSS for webpage design.

The JavaScript logo is shown below:

For this challenge, I was expected to write a program based off of the **FizzBuzz** game. This happens to be a challenge used for interviewing programmer job applicants. In this case, I was expected to write this program in order to:  
* understand the basics of **JavaScript** and its interaction with **HTML**  
* show our programming proficientcy  
* be able understand how to use a plain text editor  

The code is shown below:  
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Fizz Buzz</title>
<script>

function fizzbuzz() {
	var display = document.getElementById('display');
	var displayHTML = "";
	for (i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
		if (i % 15 === 0) {
			document.write("FizzBuzz" + "<br>");
		} else if (i % 3 === 0) {
			document.write("Fizz" + "<br>");
		} else if (i % 5 === 0) {
			document.write("Buzz" + "<br>");
		} else {
			document.write(i + "<br>");
		}
		displayHTML += "<p>" + i + "</p>";
	}
	display.innerHTML = displayHTML
}

</script>

</head>

<body onload="fizzbuzz()">
<div id="display">

</div>
</body>

</html>
```

The expected output looks like this:

This concludes my introduction to Javascript. Thank you for reading!
