            This my welcome page for information about what I am doing in my class <i>INFOTEC 1000</i>. <i>INFOTEC 1000</i> is properly known as INFOTEC 1000: Introduction to Information Technology. This class serves as an introduction to topics and jobs within the IT field. I am currently taking this class as one of my first classes as an IT major. This website is to discuss the different types of projects and programming languages that I have learned throughout this course thus far.</p>

        <p>
            I am currently using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Git Hub</a> to host this personal website.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the first programs I ever wrote was a program called <i>AboutMe.py</i> which was a simple code meant to introduce us to the Python syntax.  

            The intro code is as shown below:  

            print("Hello, my name is Faith Carter.")  
            print("I am in this class because I am majoring in information technology.")  
            print("I am a sophomore.")  
            print("I am a transfer student.")  
        </p>

        <p>
