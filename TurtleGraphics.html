[Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) are a form of **vector graphics** that were often used to [introduce programming to children](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). For this challenge in _INFOTEC 1000_, we were instructed to create images by using Python to program the Turtle graphics. For more about my usage of Python, check [here](pythonbeginnings.md).

Here is a common type of graphic created using Turtle graphics:

For this challenge, Turtle graphics were used in order to teach us:
* how Python can be used for varying functions  
* be able to use code to create an image
* understand the usage of Turtle graphics

The code I used is shown below:  
```
import turtle

flower = turtle.Turtle()

ANIMATION_SPEED = 10

#main red flower
flower.pencolor("#DC1C13")

for i in range(25):
    flower.forward(i * 15)
    flower.right(130)

#medium pink flower
flower.pencolor("#F07470")

for i in range(20):
    flower.backward(i * 15)
    flower.left(130)
    
# smaller pink flower
flower.pencolor("#F6BDC0")

for i in range(15):
    flower.forward(i*15)
    flower.right(130)

turtle.speed(ANIMATION_SPEED)

turtle.done()
```

The output of this code results in this image:

This concludes my introduction to Turtle graphics. Thank you for reading!
